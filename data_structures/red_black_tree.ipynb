    "# Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search trees\n",
    "\n",
    "# like a binary search tree, the value of each node must be greater than (or equal to) any node in its left subtree\n",
    "# and less than (or equal to) any node in its right subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "# the difference is Red-Black Tree's keep track of a seperate bit of info: each node is colored either red or black\n",
    "# the tree stays relatively balanced by checking that the following properties are maintained during insertions and deletions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# root property: the root of the tree is black\n",
    "# leaf property: every leaf (nil) node is black\n",
    "# red property: there are no two adjacent red nodes (a red node cannot have a red parent or child)\n",
    "# depth property: every path from a node to any of its descendants nil nodes has the same number of black nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "# if any of these properties are violated the tree automatically performs node recolorings/rotations to restore them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# in comparison to AVL trees:\n",
    "# less storage needed per node - only one bit to tell if node is red/black, versus storage needed for an integer for AVL node's balance factor\n",
